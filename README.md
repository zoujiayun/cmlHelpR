# cmlHelpR

This package and repository is a simple way for me to collect functions I've written to analyses `CODEML` output. 

The functions are continually being tweaked, and in many instances serve a specific purpose for what I am trying to do. Nevertheless, I've endeavoured to make the functions as extensible as possible.

In the sections below I'll demonstrate some use cases of the major functions of interest.
