# cmlHelpR

This package and repository is a simple way for me to collect functions I've written to analyses `CODEML` output. 

The functions are continually being tweaked, and in many instances serve a specific purpose for what I am trying to do. Nevertheless, I've endeavoured to make the functions as extensible as possible.

In the sections below I'll demonstrate some use cases of the major functions of interest.

## Installation
In the `R-studio` console, execute the following code.

```
> devtools::github_install("a-lud/cmlHelpR")
> library(cmlHelpR)
```
