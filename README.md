# cmlHelpR

This repository houses accessory functions for the codeml_parallel pipeline I've put together. These are a series of R packages that conduct a range of functions like parsing information from `codeml` output to conducting LRT statistics between models.


## Necessary updates:

- Addition of `writeMultifasta()` function
    - Need to ensure the key-value mapping appriach is generalised first
